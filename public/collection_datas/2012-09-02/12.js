We discuss here the major types of media used in advertising. We focus our attention on seven types of advertising: television, newspapers, radio, magazines, out-of-home, Internet, and direct mail. </p>\n<p><br></p><p>Television </p>\n<p>Television is an attractive medium for advertising because it delivers mass audiences to advertisers. When you consider that nearly three out of four Americans have seen the game show \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\" you can understand the power of television to communicate with a large audience. When advertisers create a brand, for example, they want to impress consumers with the brand and its image. Television provides an ideal vehicle for this type of communication. But television is an expensive medium, and not all advertisers can afford to use it. </p>\n<p>Television's influence on advertising is fourfold. First, narrowcasting means that television channels are seen by an increasingly narrow segment of the audience. The Golf Channel, for instance, is watched by people who play golf. Home and Garden Television is seen by those interested in household improvement projects. Thus, audiences are smaller and more homogeneous(\u5177\u6709\u5171\u540c\u7279\u70b9\u7684) than they have been in the past. Second, there is an increase in the number of television channels available to viewers, and thus, advertisers.&nbsp;This has also resulted in an increase in the sheer number of advertisements to which audiences are exposed. Third, digital recording devices allow audience members more control over which commercials they watch. Fourth, control over programming is being passed from the networks to local cable operators and satellite programmers.</p>\n<p><br></p><p>&nbsp;Newspaper</p>\n<p>After television, the medium attracting the next largest annual ad revenue is newspapers. The New York Times, which reaches a national audience, accounts for $1 billion in ad revenue annually. It has increased its national circulation (\u53d1\u884c\u91cf) by 40% and is now available for home delivery in 168 cities. Locally, newspapers are the largest advertising medium. </p>\n<p>Newspapers are a less expensive advertising medium than television and provide a way for advertisers to communicate a longer, more detailed message to their audience than they can through television. Given new production techniques, advertisements can be printed in newspapers in about 48 hours, meaning newspapers are also a quick way of getting the massage out. Newspapers are often the most important form of news for a local community, and they develop a high degree of loyalty from local readers.</p>\n<p><br></p><p>Radio</p>\n<p>Advertising on radio continues to grow. Radio is often used in conjunction with outdoor billboards (\u5e7f\u544a\u724c) and the Internet to reach even more customers than television. Advertisers are likely to use radio because it is a less expensive medium than television, which means advertisers can afford to repeat their ads often. Internet companies are also turning to radio advertising. Radio provides a way for advertisers to communicate with audience members at all times of the day. Consumers listen to radio on their way to school or work, at work, on the way home, and in the evening hours.&nbsp;</p><p>Two major changes\u2014satellite and Internet radio\u2014will force radio advertisers to adapt their methods. Both of these radio forms allow listeners to tune in stations that are more distant than the local stations they could receive in the past. As a result, radio will increasingly attract target audiences who live many miles apart. </p><p><br></p>\n<p>Magazines </p>\n<p>Newsweeklies, women\u2019s titles, and business magazines have all seen in increases in advertising because they attract the high-end market. Magazines are popular with advertisers because of the narrow market that they deliver. A broadcast medium such as network television&nbsp;attracts&nbsp;all types of audience members, but magazine audiences are more homogeneous. If you read \"Sports Illustrated\", for example, you have much in common with the magazine\u2019s other readers. Advertisers see magazines as an efficient way of reaching target audience members.&nbsp;</p><p>Advertisers using the print media - magazines and newspapers - will need to adapt to two main changes. First, the Internet will bring larger audiences to local newspapers. These audiences will be more diverse and geographically dispersed(\u5206\u6563) than in the past. Second,&nbsp;advertisers&nbsp;will have to understand how to use an increasing number of magazines for their target audiences. Although some magazines will maintain national audiences, a large number of magazines will entertain narrower audiences.</p><p><br></p>\n<p>Out-of-home advertising</p><p>Out-of-home advertising, also called place-based advertising, has become an increasingly&nbsp;effective&nbsp;way of reaching consumers, who are more active than ever before. &nbsp;Many consumers today do not sit at home and watch television. &nbsp;Using billboards, newsstands, and bus shelters for&nbsp;advertising&nbsp;is an effective way of reaching these on-the-go consumers. More consumers travel longer distances to and from work, which also makes out-of-home advertising effective. &nbsp;Technology has changed the nature of the billboard business, making it a more effective medium than in the past. &nbsp;Using digital printing, billboard companies can print a billboard in 2 hours, compared with 6 days previously. &nbsp;This allows advertisers more variety in the types of messages they create because they can change their messages more quickly.</p><p><br></p><p>Internet </p>\n<p>As consumers become more comfortable with online shopping, advertisers will seek to reach this market. As consumers get more of their news and information from the Internet, the ability of television and radio to get the word out to consumers will decrease.&nbsp;The challenge to Internet advertisers is to create ads that audience members remember.&nbsp;</p><p>Internet advertising will play a more prominent role in organizations\u2019 advertising in the near&nbsp;future. Internet audiences tend to be quite homogeneous, but small. Advertisers will have to adjust their methods to reach these audiences and will have to adapt their persuasive strategies to the online medium as well.</p><p><br></p>\n<p>Direct mail&nbsp;</p><p>A final advertising medium is direct mail, which uses mailings to consumers to communicate a client's message. Direct mail includes newsletters, postcards and special promotions. Direct mail is an effective way to build relationships with consumers. For many businesses, direct mail is the most effective from of advertising.</p>\n                    ","category":"2","questions":{"question":[{"correct_type":"0","id":"349","score":"0.0","description":"Advertising on radio continues to grow because ___________.

In fact, one in four workers is dissatisfied with their current job, according to the recent \u201cPlans for 2004\u201d survey. Their career path may be financially rewarding, but it doesn\u2019t meet their emotional, social or creative needs. They\u2019re stuck, unhappy, and have no idea what to do about it, except move to another job.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nMary Lyn Miller, veteran career consultant and founder of the Life<br />\nand Career Clinic, says that when most people are unhappy about their work, their first thought is to get a different job. Instead, Miller suggests looking at the possibility of a different life. Through her book, 8 Myths of Making a Living, as well as workshops, seminars and personal coaching and consulting, she has helped thousands of dissatisfied workers reassess life and work.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nLike the way of Zen, which includes understanding of oneself as one really is, Miller encourages job seekers and those dissatisfied with work or life to examine their beliefs about work and recognize that \u201cin many cases your beliefs are what brought you to where you are today.\u201d You may have been raised to think that women were best at nurturing and caring and, therefore, should be teachers and nurses. So that\u2019s what you did. Or, perhaps you were brought up to believe that you should do what your father did, so you have taken over the family business, or become a<br />\ndentist \u201cjust like dad.\u201d If this sounds familiar, it\u2019s probably time to look at the new possibilities for your future.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nMiller developed a 7-step process to help potential job seekers<br />\nassess their current situation and beliefs, identify their real passion, and start on a journey that allows them to pursue their passion through work.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nStep 1: Willingness to do something different.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nBreaking the cycle of doing what you have always done is one of the most difficult tasks for job seekers. Many find it difficult to steer away from a career path or make a change, even if it doesn\u2019t feel right. Miller urges job seekers to open their minds to other possibilities beyond what they are currently doing.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nStep 2: Commitment to being who you are, not who or what someone wants you to be.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nLook at the gifts and talents you have and make a commitment to pursue those things that you love most. If you love the social aspects of your job, but are stuck inside an office or \u201cchained to your desk\u201d most of the time, vow to follow your instinct and investigate alternative careers and work that allow you more time to interact with others. Dawn worked as a manager for a<br />\nlarge retail clothing store for several years. Though she had advanced within the company, she felt frustrated and longed to be involved with nature and the outdoors. She decided to go to school nights and weekends to pursue her true passion by earning her master\u2019s degree in forestry. She now works in the biotech forestry division of a major paper company.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nStep 3: Self-definition<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nMiller suggests that once job seekers know who they are, they need to know how to sell themselves. \u201cIn the job market, you are a product. And just like a product, you most know the features and benefits that you have to offer a potential client, or employer.\u201d Examine the skills and knowledge that you have identify how they can apply to your desired occupation. Your qualities will exhibit to employers why they should hire you over other candidates.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nStep 4: Attain a level of self-honoring.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nSelf-honoring or self-love may seem like an odd step for job hunters, but being able to accept yourself, without judgment, helps eliminate insecurities and will make you more self-assured. By accepting who you are \u2013 all your emotions, hopes and dreams, your personality, and your unique way of being \u2013 you\u2019ll project more confidence when networking and talking with potential employers. The power of self-honoring can help to break all the<br />\nfalsehoods you were programmed to believe \u2013 those that made you feel that you were not good enough, or strong enough, or intelligent enough to do what you truly desire.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nStep 5: Vision.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nMiller suggests that job seekers develop a vision that embraces the answer to \u201cWhat do I really want to do?\u201d one should create a solid statement in a dozen or so sentences that describe in detail how they see their life related to work. For instance, the secretary who longs to be an actress describes a life that allows her to express her love of Shakespeare on stage. A real estate<br />\nagent, attracted to his current job because her loves fixing up old homes, describes buying properties that need a little tender loving care to make them more saleable.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nStep 6: Appropriate risk.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nSome philosophers believe that the way to enlightenment comes through facing obstacles and difficulties. Once people discover their passion, many are too scared to do anything about it. Instead, they do nothing. With this step, job seekers should assess what they are willing to give up, or risk, in pursuit<br />\nof their dream. For one working mom, that meant taking night classes to learn new computer-aided design skills, while still earning a salary and keeping her day job. For someone else, it may mean quitting his or her job, taking out loan and going back to school full time. You\u2019ll move one step closer to your ideal work life if you identify how much risk you are willing to take and the sacrifices you are willing to make.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nStep 7: Action.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nSome teachers of philosophy describe action in this way, \u201cIf one<br />\nwants to get to the top of a mountain, just sitting at the foot thinking about it will not bring one there. It is by making the effort of climbing up the mountain, step by step, that eventually the summit is reached.\u201d All too often, it is the lack of action that ultimately holds people back from attaining their ideals. Creating a plan and taking it one step at a time can lead to new and different job opportunities. Job-hunting tasks gain added meaning as you sense their importance in your quest for a more meaningful work life. The plan can include researching industries and occupations, talking to people who are in your desired area of work, taking classes, or accepting volunteer work in your<br />\ntargeted field.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nEach of these steps will lead you on a journey to a happier and more rewarding work life. After all, it is the journey, not the destination, that is most important.","category":"3","questions":{"question":[{"correct_type":"0","flag":"0","id":"2710","score":"0.0","description":"According to the recent \u201cPlans for 2004\u201d survey, most people are unhappy with their current jobs.","questionattrs":"Y;-;N;-;NG","tags":" \u5feb\u901f\u9605\u8bfb","words":"dissatisfied;rewarding","answer":"N","analysis":"\u9996\u5148\u8981\u6839\u636e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8bcd \"Plans for 2004\" \u627e\u5230\u6587\u7ae0\u7684\u7b2c1\u6bb5\u7b2c2\u53e5\u3002 \"In fact, one in four workers is dissatisfied with their current job, according to the recent Plans for 2004 survey.\" \u9898\u5e72\u4e2d\u7684most\u4e0e\u539f\u6587one in four\u663e\u7136\u4e0d\u7b26\uff0c\u6545\u7b54\u6848\u4e3aN\u3002","user_answer":"Y"}]},"paper_id":"76"}]}}
