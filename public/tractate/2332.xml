      People are not so honest as they once were.[] The temptation to steal is greater than ever before -- especially in large shops.[] A detective recently watched a well-dressed woman who always went into a large store on Monday mornings.[] One Monday, there were fewer people in the shop than usual when the woman came in, so it was easier for the detective to watch her.[] The woman first bought a few small articles.[] After a little time, she chose one of the most expensive dresses in the shop and handed it to an assistant who wrapped it up for her as quickly as possible.[] Then the woman simply took the parcel and walked out of the shop without paying.[] When she was arrested, the detective found out that the shop assistant was her daughter.[] The girl 'gave' her mother a free dress once a week!

    购物变得很方便
    人们不再像以前那样诚实了。偷窃的诱惑力比以往任何时候都更强烈 -- 特别是在大的商店里。一名侦探最近注意上了一位穿着讲究的妇女，她总是在星期一上午进入一家大商场。有一个星期一，当这位妇女走进这家商场时，里面的人比往常少，因此，侦探比较容易监视她。这位妇女先是买了几样小商品。过了一会儿，她又选了商场里最昂贵的一件衣服，把它递给了售货员。那售货员以最快的速度为她包好了衣服。然后，那妇女拿过包就走出了商场，根本没有付钱。她被逮捕后。侦探发现原来那售货员是她的女儿。那姑娘每星期“送”她母亲一件免费的衣服！
