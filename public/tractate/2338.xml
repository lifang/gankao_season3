      My old friend, Harrison, had lived in the Mediterranean for many years before he returned to England.[] He had often dreamed of retiring in England and had planned to settle down in the country.[] He had no sooner returned than he bought a house and went to live there.[] Almost immediately he began to complain about the weather, for even though it was still summer, it rained continually and it was often bitterly cold.[] After so many years of sunshine, Harrison got a shock.[] He acted as if he had never lived in England before.[] In the end, it was more than he could bear.[] He had hardly had time to settle down when he sold the house and left the country.[] The dream he had had for so many years ended there.[] Harrison had thought of everything except the weather

    唯独没有考虑到天气
    我的老朋友哈里森在回到英国以前曾多年居住在地中海地区。过去他常幻想退休后到英国，并计划在乡间安顿下来。他刚一回到英国便买下了一幢房子住了进去。但紧接着他就开始抱怨那里的天气了。因为即使那时仍为夏季，但雨总是下个不停，而且常常冷得厉害。在阳光下生活了那么多年的哈里森对此感到惊奇。他的举动就好像他从未在英国生活过一样。最后，他再也忍受不住，还没等安顿下来就卖掉了房子，离开了这个国家。他多年来的幻想从此破灭。哈里森把每件事情都考虑到了，唯独没想到天气。
