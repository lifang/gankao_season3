      The Wayle is a small river that cuts across the park near my home.[] I like sitting by the Wayle on fine afternoons.[] It was warm last Sunday, so I went and sat on the river bank as usual.[] Some children were playing games on the bank and there were some people rowing on the river.[] Suddenly, one of the children kicked a ball very hard and it went towards a passing boat.[] Some people on the bank called out to the man in the boat, but he did not hear them.[] The ball struck him so hard that he nearly fell into the water.[] I turned to look at the children, but there weren't any in sight: they had all run away! The man laughed when he realized what had happened.[] He called out to the children and threw the ball back to the bank.[]

    足球还是水球？
    威尔河是横穿过我家附近公园的一条小河。我喜欢在天气晴朗的下午到河边坐坐。上星期日天气很暖和。于是我和往常一样，又去河边坐着。河岸上有些孩子正在玩耍，河面上有些人正在划船。突然，一个孩子狠狠地踢了一脚球，球便向着一只划过来的小船飞去。岸上的一些人对着小船上的人高喊，但他没有听见。球重重地打在他身上，使他差点儿落入水中。我转过头去看那些孩子，但一个也不见，全都跑了！当那个人明白了发生的事情时，笑了起来。他大声叫着那些孩子，把球扔回到岸上。
